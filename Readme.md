This stuff is what I was trying to get at with all the continuation talk.
I was able to install folly on my home computer and get some stuff working.
I'm still working on the server side of things, but I really like how the client
side turned out.

The really important (as of this moment) files are src/client/admin_client.cpp, include/admin_message.hpp, and message_base.hpp/message_base-inl.hpp.
